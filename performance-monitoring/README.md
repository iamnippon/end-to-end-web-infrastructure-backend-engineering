# Performance Monitoring & Optimization

This section demonstrates backend and frontend performance monitoring techniques.

Implemented Concepts:

- Execution time measurement
- Database query profiling
- Synthetic transaction monitoring (STM)
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Performance logging

Performance Areas Analyzed:

- Application processing time
- Database response latency
- API availability
- Client-side page load metrics

This module simulates real-world monitoring strategies used in production systems.
