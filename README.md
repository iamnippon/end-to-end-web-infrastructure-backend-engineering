# End-to-End Web Infrastructure & Backend Engineering Project

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a complete backend web infrastructure pipeline — from server configuration to secure eCommerce deployment and performance optimization.

The objective of this project was to simulate a real-world web systems engineering environment by integrating:

* Web server configuration
* Backend application development
* Database-driven systems
* CMS customization
* Secure online transactions
* Performance monitoring and optimization

This repository documents the technical architecture, implementation experiments, and system-level understanding gained throughout the project.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The project follows a multi-layered architecture model:

```
Client (Browser)
      ↓
Apache Web Server
      ↓
PHP Backend Application Layer
      ↓
MySQL Database
      ↓
CMS Layer (Joomla Modules & Extensions)
      ↓
Security & Performance Monitoring Layer
```

This layered approach ensures:

* Scalability
* Maintainability
* Security
* Performance optimization
